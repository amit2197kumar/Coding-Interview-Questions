#Count number of subset with given difference

##Problem Statement:

Given an array and a value VAL, count the number of subsets that will give us the difference VAL.

###Example:

arr[] : 1, 1, 2, 3

VAL. : 1

*Ans: 3*

* [1+3] - [1+2]
* [1+3] - [1+2]
* [1+1+2] - [3]

##Approach:

Let say the 2 sunset are S1 and S2

Given : S1 - S2 = VAL [1]

Let say the sum of all elements of the array is : SUM

then we can also say: S1 + S2 = SUM [2]

Adding above two equations:

     S1 - S2 = VAL
    +S1 + S2 = SUM
------------------------------
    2S1  = VAL + SUM

So now we have 2S1 = VAL + SUM

→ 2S1 = VAL + SUM

→ S1 = (VAL + SUM)/2

Now id we see the above equation carefully, we will notice only S1 is unknown, we know the rest of the value.

Applying in the above Question:

* VAL is 1

* SUM is 7

→ S1 = (VAL + SUM)/2

→ S1 = (1 + 7)/2

→ S1 = 4

So the solution deduced to : [Count of subsets with sum equal to 4](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-of-subsets-with-sum-equal-to-x/)

We will apply this approach and implement in the question [Target Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/target-sum/)
